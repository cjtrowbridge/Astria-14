# Astria-14
A simple and secure framework for managing databases and marketing.  

Astria understands databases, and generates procedural pages for interacting with data. These pages can be replaced with your own, or left as they are.  

Astria manages your users. It authenticates them and gives you access to their data simply. It even manages user permissions for you at scale. Users can authenticate through email, oauth, and eventually other protocols like LDAP, ADDC, etc.  

Astria manages marketing tools. Integration with Mailchimp and other email providers allows you to run automatic marketing based on customer behaviors.  

Astria has been in continuous development since 2001.  

## Major Goals with this version

Functionality is split into object-oriented modules with static functions minimized.
